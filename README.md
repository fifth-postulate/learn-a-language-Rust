# learn a language: Rust
Material for the devnology event; learn a language Rust

On 25 February 2016 [Devnology][devnology] is organizing the event [learn a language: Rust][event]. During this event we are exploring [Rust][rustlang]. Rust is described as

> a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. 

during the event we will dive into the language head first. This repository gathers the material that will be used for the exploration.
